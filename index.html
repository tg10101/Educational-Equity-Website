   <center> <p class = "abouttext1"> <b> Why is this important? </b> </p> </center>
   <center> <p  class = "abouttext1"> Education for girls is important as girls aren't often encouraged to pursue an education. This is due to the fact that there is less importance given to a girl's education as opposed to education for boys. By promoting educational equity for young girls, we are teaching girls how to be courageous and adovcate for their education, allowing them to make something of themselves as well as helping them develop a passion for something. This issue is most prevalent in third-world countries and it still exists today. Thankfully, there has been some improvement in terms of encouraging girls to attend school; however, this issue still exists and it needs to be addressed. </p> </center>

   <center> <p class = "abouttext1"> <b> Why is this important? </b> </p> </center>
   <center> <p  class = "abouttext1"> Similar to a lack of representation for young girls, underrepresented boys and girls are at a disadvantage in various education systems. The primary cause is due to a lack of educational resources they have been provided. Several low-income students and even pupils of certain minority groups who are underrepresented, will feel discouraged to seek these educational opportunities, hindering their ability of setting themselves up for success. </p> </center>
